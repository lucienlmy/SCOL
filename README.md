# SCOL
Allows you to load RAGE scripts (`.sco` files) for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced. It also exposes new native commands that extend the capabilities of RAGE Scripting Language. See the documentation [here](https://github.com/ShinyWasabi/SCOL/blob/main/NATIVES.md).

## How It Works
Although the SCO format is never used in GTA V, the game engine still has the support for loading it. However, scripts compiled for other RAGE titles are not directly compatible due to different SCO header and incompatible natives and globals.

SCOL works by creating a script thread using the unused SCO loader. This function loads a `.sco` file from a specified path on disk and creates a script program and thread for it automatically.

An example script to test is available [here](https://github.com/ShinyWasabi/SCOL/raw/main/hello_world.sco), and a full singleplayer mod menu with source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ShinyWasabi/RageMenu.git).

If you want to load YSC scripts, you need to convert them to SCO (without the RSC7 header) using [YSC2SCO.exe](https://github.com/ShinyWasabi/SCOL/raw/main/YSC2SCO.exe). I won't provide the source code for this program due to reasons.

## Installation
- Get `SCOL.asi` from `.\out\build\Release` after building the project.
- Download [xinput1_4.dll](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/xinput1_4-x64.zip).
- Place both files in the game directory where `GTA5_Enhanced.exe` is located.
- Launch the game. Make sure BattlEye is disabled.

## Usage
- By default, scripts are loaded from the game's current directory. You can change this in `SCOL.ini`.
- The default key to reload all scripts is `F5`. This is also configurable in the `.ini` file.
- When a script is loaded for the first time, a new section is added to `SCOL.ini`:
```ini
[examplescript]
Args=0
ArgCount=0
StackSize=1424
CleanupFunction=0
```
You can edit these values as needed for your script. Use the `0,1,2,3` format to pass arguments. For `CleanupFunction`, you can pass the address of the function that you want to be called whenever scripts are reloaded. Note that it must not take any arguments.

You can override game scripts by placing custom scripts in the directory specified by `ScriptOverridesFolder`. When the game attempts to load a script, its hash is checked against the scripts in that directory; if a matching hash is found, the custom script is loaded instead of the original.
